# Minecraft Coordinate Map

日本語版はこちら → [README.ja.md](./README.ja.md)

This is a web page that visualizes Minecraft coordinates on a grid-based map using CSV data.

It is an unofficial tool created by an individual developer (me!) to enhance the enjoyment of watching **[Shiga Riko](https://www.youtube.com/@ShigaRiko)**, a VTuber from the Japanese group *NIJISANJI*, play Minecraft. It also served as a project to experiment with programming and low-code development.

## Features

- Displays locations and coordinates defined in a CSV file on the map
- You can pan and zoom the map using your mouse (drag and scroll)
- Enter X and Z coordinates into the input box to mark your current location with a yellow circle
- A table at the bottom of the page lists the CSV data; hovering over a row highlights the corresponding point on the map
- If you enter text||URL in the Related URL column, the text becomes a clickable hyperlink
- A simplified coordinate list is shown in a drawer on the right (click to jump to a location)
- Sun icons (↖ / ↙) are displayed on the sides of the map to indicate east and west (can be toggled ON/OFF)
- Direction labels can be set to follow the origin or remain fixed on the screen edges; display language can be switched between Japanese and English
- Optionally displays coordinates or a compass circle that follows the mouse cursor
- A guide page explaining how to read coordinates and directions in Minecraft is also available (currently under adjustment and not yet linked from the top page).

- **Data (CSV files)**:  
  The coordinate data was recorded and organized by the author as a viewer of YouTube streams. Since it is based on publicly visible game coordinates, it is considered to have minimal originality.  
  No specific license applies to the data, but it may be used only for viewing on the published page or for testing the code provided.

## Notes

This project was developed as part of an experiment in low-code development using generative AI.  
The code was written with the assistance of **ChatGPT-4o**, and final structuring, adjustments, and testing were done manually.
