# Minecraft Coordinate Map

日本語版はこちら → [README.ja.md](./README.ja.md)

This is a web page that visualizes Minecraft coordinates on a grid-based map using CSV data.

It is an unofficial tool created by an individual developer (me!) to enhance the enjoyment of watching **[Shiga Riko](https://www.youtube.com/@ShigaRiko)**, a VTuber from the Japanese group *NIJISANJI*, play Minecraft. It also served as a project to experiment with programming and low-code development.

## Features

- Displays locations and coordinates defined in a CSV file on a grid-based map.
- You can pan and zoom the map using your mouse (drag and scroll).
- Enter X and Z coordinates into the input box to mark your current location with a yellow circle.
- A table at the bottom of the page shows the contents of the CSV data.
- Entering "text||URL" in the Related URL column displays a clickable text link
- A guide page explaining how to read coordinates and directions in Minecraft is also available (currently under adjustment and not yet linked from the top page).

## License

- **Code (HTML/JS/CSS)**: Released under the MIT License.
- **Data (CSV files)**:  
  The coordinate data was recorded and organized by the author as a viewer of YouTube streams. Since it is based on publicly visible game coordinates, it is considered to have minimal originality.  
  No specific license applies to the data, but it may be used only for viewing on the published page or for testing the code provided.

## Notes

This project was developed as part of an experiment in low-code development using generative AI.  
The code was written with the assistance of **ChatGPT-4o**, and final structuring, adjustments, and testing were done manually.
